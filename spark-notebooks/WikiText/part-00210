VereArticle gives meaning of uncommon name. Wikipedia is not a gyneology site, and I don't think this page can be expanded. Either merge into the more common name; like Veronica or Veronique or delete. Mgm| (talk)  10:52, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)

Merge to Veronica. Radiant  11:29, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)
Wiktionary has Wiktionary:Wiktionary Appendix:First names, where this would be listed under Wiktionary:Wiktionary Appendix:First names female ven-vez.  I've encouraged the article's author, who has already added several dictionary entries to the encyclopaedia, to redirect xyr efforts to the dictionary instead.  Delete.
