To get revenge, she plays a joke by passing out notes to some of the guests reading, "Consult your conscience. Your secret is common gossip." This message sends a number of people into a panic during the party, and a shot rings out, wounding one of the men. When the mystery is cleared up, Marion Taylor (Billie Dove) and Edward Mallory (Harry Morey) have fallen in love.

Production notesClara Bow made her film debut in Beyond the Rainbow after winning a beauty and acting magazine sponsored contest. She filmed five scenes but, after seeing the film in Brooklyn, thought that she was cut from the film. Bow was devastated and put temporarily her acting ambitions aside.  However, newspaper advertisements and editorial comments suggests she was not cut at all, at least not from the main release.
