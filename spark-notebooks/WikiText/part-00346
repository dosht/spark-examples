 The result of the debate was REDIRECT to Kyoto Protocol seems the obvious thing to do. -Splash  talk   23:18, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
Kyoto CreditsI propose this article to be deleted. What is described is vaguely similar to the CDM, and perhaps mixed up with green investment schemes. The term the author used 'kyoto credits' is sometimes used interchangeably with credits from CDM and JI, though it is not official terminology. The author also cites no sources.

Merge/redirect to Kyoto Protocol (Kyoto Protocol seems to have the relevant info, more could be added there). -- Jonel | Speak 02:15, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
Well, I suggest simply delete, as I doubt the term is clearly defined. If you do want to have a redirect, I suggest Flexible Mechanisms instead. Jens Nielsen 21:37, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

  This AfD is being relisted to generate a clearer consensus.  Please add new discussion below this notice.  Thanks!  Deathphoenix 21:26, 27 February 2006 (UTC) 

Keep or merge per CyclePat --Colonel Cow 21:48, 27 February 2006 (UTC)
Redirect to Kyoto Protocol or to some article on emissions trading scheme (too lazy to look up what it'd be right now).  The term Kyoto Credits isn't notable itself. MLA 11:52, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
