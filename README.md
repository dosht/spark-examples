Simple Spark examples

These examples runs on scala 2.10 which is still not supported on spark master branch so you need first to clone the spark and build it on the scala-2.10 branch as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:apache/incubator-spark.git
cd incubator-spark
git checkout scala-2.10
sbt publish-local
```

The previous steps works on scala 2.10.3 and sbt 0.13.0
