SVM Classifier over Spark - (Python)
========================================

This my first trial to use [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) with [spark](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/).

1. Define a system variable called SPARK_HOME that points to your clone of spark source code in your file system
```
export SPARK_HOME="/osrc/incubator-spark" # a location in your file system
```

2. Add pyspark to your PYTHONPATH
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/osrc/incubator-spark/python # a location in your file system
```

3. Run the example
```
python SimpleApp.py
```
